## Description

The goal of this project is to create a platform where the user can enter one ingredient and the application provides a random recipe with a picutre, the ingredients list, and a link to the directions of the recipe for the searched ingredient. There will also be a random gif provided based off the user's input. The user's search history will be kept in a list and will be displayed once the search is done. The user can click on a previous search item to display the information again. Each search will be stored into local storage which allows the recipe to remain in the history if the page is reloaded.
